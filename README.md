This is a replacement for the extremely awful and mad thing called Metaprog Online (Метапрог Онлайн).

It plugs into libpurple-based clients. Only GNU/Linux is supported for now.

To connect to the main (and the only one for now) Metaprog Online server, you need to set the Tor connection in account settings and put in the .onion address and the port of the server.
